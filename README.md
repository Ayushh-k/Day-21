Ques 1: Write C++ program to create a doubly linkedlist and insert a node at any position . Input Linkedlist: 2<->4<->5 ,p = 2, x = 6 Output: 2 4 5 6, Explanation: p = 2, and x = 6. So, 6 is
inserted after p, i.e, at position 3
(0-based indexing).

Ques 2: Write C++ program that detect the cycle inside a given linkedlist if their is any cycle present then print true otherwise print false. Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1. Output: true. Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
